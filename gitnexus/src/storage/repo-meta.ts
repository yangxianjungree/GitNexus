/**
 * Repo metadata primitives — the bottom layer of `storage/`.
 *
 * Holds the on-disk shape of a GitNexus index's metadata file
 * (`.gitnexus/gitnexus.json`, plus its legacy `meta.json` mirror) and the
 * read-side helpers that locate and parse it. Nothing here writes. Path
 * lookup may consult configured or registered storage via `resolveStoragePath`;
 * registry mutation stays in `repo-manager.ts`.
 *
 * Why it is its own module: `repo-manager.ts` owns the registry and the write
 * side, and `branch-index.ts` (#2106) owns the multi-branch slug/placement
 * logic — but `resolveBranchPlacement` has to READ the flat slot's metadata to
 * decide who owns it. That made `branch-index` import values back out of
 * `repo-manager`, which imports values out of `branch-index`: a genuine
 * two-way runtime cycle that was only ESM-safe because neither side touched the
 * other at module-evaluation time. Rather than keep relying on that timing,
 * the shared read primitives moved DOWN here, where both layers can import them
 * and neither imports the other back.
 *
 * `repo-manager.ts` re-exports the public names (`RepoMeta`,
 * `AnalyzerRunnerIdentity`, `getStoragePath`, `loadMeta`, `INDEX_METADATA_FILE`,
 * `isMissingFilesystemError`) so every existing import site keeps working
 * unchanged.
 *
 * Imports `node:fs`/`node:path` and a few type-only summary shapes. Keep it that way: a
 * value import here would land in every consumer of `storage/`.
